Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.
Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
fastText is a library for learning of word embeddings and text classification created by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) lab.
The model allows one to create an unsupervised learning or supervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words.
Facebook makes available pretrained models for 294 languages.
Several papers describe the techniques used by fastText.
